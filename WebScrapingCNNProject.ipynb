NWSB Bank and FCB Bank will formally adopt the ACNB Bank name and brand identity in the counties of Carroll and Frederick in central Maryland, respectively, effective January 1, 2023. At that time, ACNB Bank, the legal entity and chartered financial institution, will begin retiring the use of the division names in the Maryland communities served.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0“We have been operating NWSB Bank and FCB Bank as divisions of ACNB Bank since 2017 and 2020, respectively, which has provided our acquired new customers with ample time to become better acquainted with our community bank and to experience the unwavering commitment we have in our local markets. We believe this brand alignment will eliminate any confusion for our customers who bank in multiple markets, as well as will allow us to operate more cohesively under one name and one brand throughout our footprint in southcentral Pennsylvania and central Maryland. There will also be a stronger association in all markets between the Bank and the insurance subsidiary, ACNB Insurance Services, Inc.,” said James P. Helt, ACNB Corporation President & Chief Executive Officer.Mr. Helt continued, “Our goal is to make this brand alignment as seamless as possible for our retail and business customers in the Maryland markets. All account numbers will remain the same. Only the name of the Bank will change. New signage depicting the ACNB Bank logo and its deep blue color scheme will begin to appear both inside and outside of the Bank’s offices in the first quarter of 2023. More significantly, with a history that spans 165 years, we are proud to continue and share our established community banking legacy in central Maryland as ACNB Bank.” Historically, ACNB Corporation completed the acquisition of New Windsor Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, New Windsor State Bank, headquartered in Taneytown, MD, effective July 1, 2017. At that time, ACNB Bank elected to operate in the Carroll County, MD, market as “NWSB Bank, A Division of ACNB Bank” and has been doing so for more than five years. Likewise, ACNB Corporation completed the acquisition of Frederick County Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Frederick County Bank, headquartered in Frederick, MD, effective January 11, 2020. At that time, ACNB Bank elected to operate in the Frederick County, MD, market as “FCB Bank, A Division of ACNB Bank” and has been doing so for nearly three years. Mr. Helt added, “ACNB Corporation’s expansion into the markets of Carroll County and Frederick County, Maryland, was strategic as we sought to grow in desirable markets that are adjacent to ACNB Bank’s southcentral Pennsylvania footprint. Profitable and sustainable organic and inorganic growth are key to ACNB Corporation’s future as we strive to enhance long-term shareholder value and to be the independent financial services provider of choice in the core markets served by building relationships and finding solutions.”ACNB Corporation, headquartered in Gettysburg, PA, is the independent $2.7 billion financial holding company for the wholly-owned subsidiaries of ACNB Bank, Gettysburg, PA, and ACNB Insurance Services, Inc., Westminster, MD.

(NASDAQ: AMTB) (the “Company” or “Amerant”) today announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the “New Repurchase Program”), pursuant to which the Company may purchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of $25 million of its shares of Class A common stock. The New Repurchase Program will be effective from January 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023. The Company will not, however, repurchase shares prior to the release of 4Q 2022 earnings in January 2023.Jerry Plush, Chairman and CEO, stated, “We are pleased to announce that our Board has authorized this new buyback program, as this will provide us with the flexibility to make prudent capital management decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interests of our shareholders. We believe having an authorization in place is an essential component of a capital management program to return value to shareholders, and we intend to opportunistically repurchase shares from time to time while preserving sufficient capital to support our future growth.”Repurchases under the New Repurchase Program may be made in the open market, by block purchase, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Repurchases of the Company’s shares of Class A common stock (and the timing thereof) will depend upon market conditions, regulatory requirements, other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities and other factors as may be considered in the Company’s sole discretion. Repurchases may also be made pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or other regulatory restrictions. The New Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of Class A common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.About Amerant Bancorp Inc.

The program is an important part of our overall capital management strategy to return value to stockholders, which includes investments in the business, M&A opportunities, share repurchases, and our regular quarterly dividend. As market conditions change, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic stock repurchases on a regular basis as part of our balanced approach to capital deployment while we maintain sufficient capital to support the continued growth of Byline.”\\n\\nUnder the new program, shares may, at the discretion of management, be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases as market conditions warrant or in privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, all as effected to the extent permitted by applicable law, including pursuant to the safe harbor provided under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Designed for women by women, Impressia Bank will be a full-service banking division of CNB Bank dedicated to the professional and financial development and advancement of women business owners and women leaders.With plans to launch in early 2023, Impressia Bank will be the sixth bank division of CNB Bank. This women-focused commercial bank will begin within the existing geographic footprint of each of CNB Bank’s five other divisions, then strategically expand beyond those borders utilizing an online presence. Impressia Bank’s online approach will be complemented by regional relationship managers and support managers, as well as specialized services such as SBA and grant advisory services, treasury management, wealth management, and private banking.\\xa0\\xa0“This is a perfect opportunity to deepen relationships and support the already high, yet growing, number of women-owned businesses,” said Wilcoxson. “A prioritization of women-owned businesses would complement other divisional growth activities and allow the Bank to provide even better banking options for more businesses in our communities.”Extending beyond traditional business banking offerings, Impressia Bank clients will have access to resources related to accelerating their business, developing appropriate business strategies, and establishing a community of women who support one another. The Bank will connect financial and other identified resources to cultivate and support the business acumen of women business owners.“We’re looking to move beyond the scope of offering traditional banking services. Our goal is to provide an entire banking and financial support network for current and prospective women leaders,” said Mr. Peduzzi. “We recognize that access to capital remains the largest barrier to market entry and success for female founders and women-owned businesses. Impressia Bank will strive to propose solutions pertaining to credit access, financial literacy, and business development to promote and encourage the small business spirit and career development of women.”CNB Bank recently launched a search for the position of Division President for Impressia Bank.Based on strong, traditional values, CNB Bank is dedicated to being the premier financial services provider in the area, focused on the changing needs of people and business in our communities by providing the highest quality service.\\xa0About CNB Financial CorporationCNB Financial Corporation is a financial holding company with consolidated assets of approximately $5.3 billion.

In general, forward-looking statements usually use words such as “may,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “plan,” “estimate,” “predict,” “continue” and “potential” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, including statements related to the expected timing of the closing of the proposed transactions between the Company and Heritage (the “Merger”), the expected returns and other benefits of the Merger to shareholders, expected improvement in operating efficiency resulting from the Merger, estimated expense reductions resulting from the transactions and the timing of achievement of such reductions, the impact on and timing of the recovery of the impact on tangible book value, and the effect of the Merger on the Company’s capital ratios. Forward-looking statements represent management’s beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.\\n\\nForward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that change over time and could cause actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. With respect to the Merger, factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to (1) the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the Merger may not be realized or take longer than anticipated to be realized, (2) disruption from the Merger with customers, suppliers, employee or other business partners relationships, (3) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of one or both of the definitive agreement in respect of the Merger, (4) the risk of successful integration of Heritage into the Company, (5) the failure to obtain the necessary approval by the shareholders of Heritage, (6) the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger, (7) the ability by the Company to obtain required governmental approvals of the Merger, (8) reputational risk and the reaction of each of the companies’ customers, suppliers, employees or other business partners to the Merger, (9) the failure of the closing conditions in the definitive agreements in respect of the Merger to be satisfied, or any unexpected delay in closing of the Merger, (10) the risk that the integration of the operations of Heritage into the operations of the Company will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected, (11) the possibility that the Merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events, (12) the dilution caused by the Company’s issuance of additional shares of its common stock in the Merger, and (13) general competitive, economic, political and market conditions. Additional factors which could affect the forward looking statements can be found in the cautionary language included under the headings “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and other documents subsequently filed by the Company with the SEC. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.\\n\\nNeither the Company nor Heritage undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For any forward-looking statements made in this communication, any exhibits hereto or any related documents, the Company and Heritage claim protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221211005070/en/'}\n",

Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date hereof. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “believes,” “continue” and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and “could.”\\n\\nForward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the following risks and uncertainties and the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” of Exhibit 13 to U.S. Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Deterioration in general business and economic conditions or turbulence in domestic or global financial markets could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities, reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions, lead to a tightening of credit, and increase stock price volatility. In addition, changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or practices could affect U.S. Bancorp in substantial and unpredictable ways. U.S. Bancorp’s results could also be adversely affected by changes in interest rates; the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and prospects; increases in unemployment rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of its investment securities; legal and regulatory developments; litigation; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; civil unrest; the effects of climate change; changes in customer behavior and preferences; breaches in data security, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements; failures to safeguard personal information; the impacts of international hostilities or geopolitical events; impacts of supply chain disruptions and rising inflation; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management’s ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. In addition, U.S. Bancorp’s acquisition of MUFG Union Bank presents risks and uncertainties, including, among others: the risk that the cost savings, any revenue synergies and other anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized or may take longer than anticipated to be realized; the possibility that the combination of MUFG Union Bank with U.S. Bancorp, including the integration of MUFG Union Bank, may be more costly or difficult to complete than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results; and there can be no assurance that the community benefits plan will achieve the results or outcome expected or anticipated by U.S. Bancorp.\\n\\nFor discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from those described in forward-looking statements, refer to U.S. Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled “Corporate Risk Profile” and “Risk Factors” contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, factors other than these risks also could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s results, and the reader should not consider these risks to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

These statements relate to expectations concerning matters that are not historical facts. Accordingly, statements that are based on management’s projections, estimates, assumptions, and judgments constitute forward-looking statements. These forward looking statements, which are based on various assumptions (some of which are beyond the Bank’s control), may be identified by reference to a future period or periods, or by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “continue”, “plan”, “approximately”, “intend”, “objective”, “goal”, “project”, or other similar terms or variations on those terms, or the future or conditional verbs such as “will”, “may”, “should”, “could”, and “would”.Such forward-looking statements reflect the Bank’s current views and expectations based largely on information currently available to the Bank’s management, and on the Bank’s current expectations, assumptions, plans, estimates, judgments, and projections about the Bank’s business and industry, and they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Although the Bank believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, contingencies, and other factors.

(NBT) (NASDAQ: NBTB) and Salisbury Bancorp, Inc. (Salisbury) (NASDAQ: SAL) announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Salisbury will merge with and into NBT. The merger consideration is 100% stock and is valued at approximately $204 million and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023 subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the shareholders of Salisbury and required regulatory approvals. The combination, approved unanimously by the boards of directors of both companies, will provide market extension for both institutions and join two high-quality franchises with long histories of service to their customers and communities.Salisbury is a premier community bank franchise headquartered in Lakeville, CT and had assets of $1.51 billion, deposits of $1.33 billion, and net loans of $1.18 billion as of September 30, 2022. Its primary subsidiary, Salisbury Bank and Trust Company, is a Connecticut-chartered commercial bank with 14 banking offices in northwestern Connecticut, the Hudson Valley region of New York and southwestern Massachusetts.Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of Salisbury common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.7450 shares of NBT common stock upon completion of the merger, which equates to a value of $35.00 per Salisbury share and based on NBT’s volume-weighted average closing stock price of $46.98 for the 10-day trading period ending on November 29, 2022.\\xa0The transaction is intended to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes, and as a result, the receipt of NBT common stock by shareholders of Salisbury is expected to be tax-free.NBT expects the transaction to be approximately 9.8% accretive to first full-year proforma GAAP earnings per share after close and 4.9% per share accretive to cash earnings excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, including fair value marks to securities and loans and the establishment of a core deposit intangible asset.\\xa0“We are very excited to partner with Salisbury and to extend our footprint into their attractive and complementary markets,” said NBT President and CEO John H. Watt, Jr. “Importantly, the organizational values upheld by the Salisbury team align very well with those of NBT.\\xa0We look forward to welcoming these dedicated financial professionals to NBT and growing our combined company together. We are also pleased that Rick Cantele, Salisbury’s President and CEO, will become a member of NBT’s Executive Management Team. Salisbury has an impressive history of service to their customers, communities and shareholders, and we are honored to have the opportunity to build on these relationships.”“We are proud to become part of a long-standing, high-performing franchise like NBT Bank,” said Salisbury President and CEO Richard J. Cantele, Jr. “We believe this combination will create significant value for Salisbury shareholders, both immediately and longer term. Furthermore, we are confident the operating philosophies shared by NBT and Salisbury will ensure that our customers continue to receive high-quality service from people they know and trust. NBT has been consistently recognized for superior customer satisfaction and offers comprehensive omni-channel solutions. Through the partnership between Salisbury and NBT, our customers will gain access to an expanded set of products, services and capabilities.”In recognition of both organizations' strong community focus, NBT has committed to maintaining charitable support in the markets served by Salisbury at consistent levels following the merger. NBT has also pledged to contribute an additional $500,000 in incremental support to demonstrate the company's ongoing commitment to these markets.Following the completion of the merger, Salisbury Bank and Trust offices will become NBT Bank, N.A. locations. NBT intends to establish a regional operations center in Lakeville, CT. The merger agreement also provides for one director from Salisbury to be added to the Board of Directors of NBT at closing.Piper Sandler & Co. served as financial advisor to NBT, and Janney Montgomery Scott LLC served as the financial advisor to Salisbury.

(TSX-V: PGC) (OTCQB: NIOVF) (Frankfurt: 4Y7 or WKN: A0M2QX) is pleased to announce results from its recently completed preliminary prospecting and sampling program over select areas of the Pic River PGE-Cu Project, located 30 km northwest of Marathon, Ontario. The property is contiguous to the western boundary of Generation Mining Limited’s Marathon Palladium Copper Project and is located on strike with Generation Mining’s Sally Deposit. The work was conducted during a five-week period from July 1 to August 7, 2022. Due to the rugged nature of the topography in this area and limited ground access, only a select number of sites were visited across the property. Additional numerous coincident magnetic-electromagnetic (EM) anomalies determined from Plato’s October 2021 Prospectair Geosurveys airborne geophysical survey will be targeted and sampled during the company’s upcoming phase 2 program.A total of 50 closely spaced soil samples were collected for Soil Gas Hydrocarbon (SGH) analysis from an area of heavy overburden in the south-central portion of the Pic River claim group. In addition to the lack of exposed bedrock, a series of high priority EM and coincident magnetic anomalies, were outlined by Plato’s airborne survey in this particular area. Results from the SGH analysis indicate a significant copper-gold anomaly which will be tested by future diamond drilling.A total of 53 rock sample grabs were also collected for standard geochemical analysis from locations across the property. Results ranged from 5 ppm to 411 ppm Cu and 3 ppb to 331 ppb Au. Both ground-based prospecting and limited helicopter support were used to access sites.To address the access issue, during this initial groundwork, considerable time was spent clearing a 10 km trail along a historic logging road to provide access to the central portion of the property. This will assist in future planned exploration work, including prospecting and mapping, access for mechanized equipment (trenching and sampling) and diamond drilling.The technical and scientific disclosures in this news release were reviewed and approved by Gerald D.

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, nor should they be relied upon as representing management’s views as of any subsequent date. These statements may include words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “appear,” “believe,” “could,” “should,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “would,” “seek,” “intend,” “probability,” “risk,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” “plans,” “potential,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are statements with respect to the Company’s beliefs, plans, expectations, objectives, goals, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For example, discussions of the effect of our expansion, benefits of the Share Repurchase Plan, trends in asset quality, capital, liquidity, the Company's ability to sell nonperforming assets, expense reductions, planned operational efficiencies and earnings from growth and certain market risk disclosures, including the impact of interest rates, tax reform, inflation, the impacts related to or resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other economic factors are based upon information presently available to management and are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations. By their nature, certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. Accordingly, our results could materially differ from those that have been estimated. The most significant factor that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include the ongoing impact of higher inflation levels, higher interest rates and general economic and recessionary concerns, all of which could impact economic growth and could cause a reduction in financial transactions and business activities, including decreased deposits and reduced loan originations, our ability to manage liquidity in a rapidly changing and unpredictable market, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and additional interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.Additional information concerning the Company and its business, including additional factors that could materially affect the Company’s financial results, is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2021, under “Part I - Item 1. Forward Looking Information” and in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Unity also plans to open a Fort Lee branch in January, expanding the bank’s footprint in Bergen County.“Ocean County has lost almost 25% of its bank branches in the past decade and county officials are concerned that senior citizens in the county are underserved by the current population of banks,” said Unity Bank President & CEO James A. Hughes. “Our commercial and residential lending team has made significant inroads serving the unmet needs of the local community so the new branch is a logical extension of these efforts. Lakewood has been the fastest growing municipality in the state so this new branch makes good sense for the community and Unity.”Earlier this year, Unity established a commercial and residential lending office at the Route 70 facility, which is located at the intersection with Airport Road. The approximate 1,800-square-foot space, previously operated as a bank branch by another financial institution, now provides the full scope of local banking services.“Community banks are an engine for economic growth in the areas where they operate,” said Hughes. “During a time when large banks are closing branches, and other community banks are consolidating, we are expanding our commitment to the local marketplace to bring our full suite of products and services to small businesses and consumers in Ocean and Bergen Counties. We are providing capital for small businesses looking to open their first store, grow their business and hire more employees as well as families looking to purchase a house, or put an addition on their existing home. The heart of our business is seamless, easy to use deposit accounts with simple payment platforms and a commitment to excellent customer service.”According to the 2020 U.S. Census, Lakewood was New Jersey's fastest-growing municipality in the past decade and is now the state's fifth-largest city. Lakewood’s population soared 46% over the past decade, increasing from 92,843 residents to 135,158. Much of the dramatic growth has been attributed to an exodus of people from New York City to Ocean County.Details of a grand opening event for the Lakewood branch will be announced in January. The Fort Lee branch will be located at 899 Palisades Avenue and is expected to be open by late January. Once the Fort Lee facility is opened, Unity Bank will provide financial services to retail, corporate and small business customers through 20 branches in Bergen, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Ocean, Somerset, Union and Warren Counties in New Jersey and Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The bank holds about $2.3 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in deposits.About Unity Bancorp, Inc.Unity Bancorp, Inc.

And it all started with her grandmother.\"My grandmother had seven kids and was left to raise them on her own after my grandfather passed away serving in the U.S. military,\" explained Trevisano Smith, who is a hub manager and works out of the U.S. Bank Fenton, Missouri, branch, in St. Louis County. \"My grandmother used to take my Dad and his siblings to downtown St. Louis and gaze at the Christmas lights in window displays. It was something that everyone looked forward to that didn\\'t cost any money.\"So, 30 years ago when Trevisano Smith was a child, her dad felt inspired to create something similar at his house for people to enjoy. \"I remember Santa Night, when my dad would dress up and my siblings and I would be elves. Eventually, a lot of people started coming out to see the lights and they wanted to give my dad something for helping create special holiday memories, so our family started accepting donations and giving the proceeds to charity.\"Since 2004, the Trevisano family has donated more than $125,000 to St. Patrick Center to help thousands of people experiencing homelessness. U.S. Bank employees have joined in the spirit of volunteerism by helping Trevisano Smith\\'s family with the Christmas lights display, which sits within a neighborhood in the Crestwood community.\"Over the years, several U.S. Bank employees have reached out and signed up as a team to volunteer at Trevisano Teddy Bear Land - sometimes braving the cold, rain, and snow,\" said Katie Joseph, St. Patrick Center\\'s director of philanthropy operations. \"The community has the opportunity to view an amazing display and offer donations to help their neighbors in need. It is also unique because the family has taken pride in this for many years, and really believe in our mission. It is not about them; it\\'s how many people they can help. I hope when people drive by the display they are filled with the joy of the season and inspired to help their community.\"Branch Manager Jason Craft, who works at the nearby Sunset Hills branch, said it\\'s a heart-warming experience to volunteer at the event and see the smiles and cheer of the visitors.\"The whole purpose is to remember those less fortunate during the holiday season and to live out the mantra of giving versus receiving,\" he said. \"The spectacular decorative display attracts onlookers to help bring the holidays to life - even with their own radio station for onlookers to tune into during their visit! I am so inspired by the family\\'s ongoing commitment, effort and sacrifice each and every year to put on such a wonderful charitable event.\"Annually, U.S. Bank gives 16 hours of paid time off for eligible employees to volunteer in their communities. Last year, employees volunteered 731 hours per day with nonprofit organizations.\"It\\'s exciting to see the company encourage our employees to get out in the community and do good for others who may not be as fortunate,\" Trevisano Smith said. \"It means a lot to me that some of my colleagues have gotten involved to help our community in this way. I\\'ve worked for U.S. Bank for 13 years and I feel like it goes back to our core values - and living out what U.S. Bank wants to represent and what I\\'m passionate about within my family.\"Trevisano Smith said her dad spends up to 400 hours putting up the lights and starts in August so he can make everything just right. Today, her own children are involved and dress up as elves.\"This is what I am trying to instill in my children - that they are blessed and Christmas isn\\'t about getting, it\\'s about giving. It\\'s about seeing others happy.\"Learn more about U.S. Bank here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.html\\\\Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732343/Missouri-Employees-Light-Up-St-Louis-Community-for-a-Good-Cause\\n]]>'}\n",

       "  'Article': 'ACNB Corporation Announces Rebranding of Maryland Banking Divisions\\nGETTYSBURG, Pa., Dec.  19, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACNB Corporation (NASDAQ: ACNB), financial holding company for ACNB Bank and ACNB Insurance Services, Inc. headquartered in Gettysburg, PA, announced plans for its banking subsidiary---ACNB Bank---to rebrand its Maryland banking divisions. NWSB Bank and FCB Bank will formally adopt the ACNB Bank name and brand identity in the counties of Carroll and Frederick in central Maryland, respectively, effective January 1, 2023. At that time, ACNB Bank, the legal entity and chartered financial institution, will begin retiring the use of the division names in the Maryland communities served.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0“We have been operating NWSB Bank and FCB Bank as divisions of ACNB Bank since 2017 and 2020, respectively, which has provided our acquired new customers with ample time to become better acquainted with our community bank and to experience the unwavering commitment we have in our local markets. We believe this brand alignment will eliminate any confusion for our customers who bank in multiple markets, as well as will allow us to operate more cohesively under one name and one brand throughout our footprint in southcentral Pennsylvania and central Maryland. There will also be a stronger association in all markets between the Bank and the insurance subsidiary, ACNB Insurance Services, Inc.,” said James P. Helt, ACNB Corporation President & Chief Executive Officer.Mr. Helt continued, “Our goal is to make this brand alignment as seamless as possible for our retail and business customers in the Maryland markets. All account numbers will remain the same. Only the name of the Bank will change. New signage depicting the ACNB Bank logo and its deep blue color scheme will begin to appear both inside and outside of the Bank’s offices in the first quarter of 2023. More significantly, with a history that spans 165 years, we are proud to continue and share our established community banking legacy in central Maryland as ACNB Bank.” Historically, ACNB Corporation completed the acquisition of New Windsor Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, New Windsor State Bank, headquartered in Taneytown, MD, effective July 1, 2017.

Mr. Helt added, “ACNB Corporation’s expansion into the markets of Carroll County and Frederick County, Maryland, was strategic as we sought to grow in desirable markets that are adjacent to ACNB Bank’s southcentral Pennsylvania footprint. Profitable and sustainable organic and inorganic growth are key to ACNB Corporation’s future as we strive to enhance long-term shareholder value and to be the independent financial services provider of choice in the core markets served by building relationships and finding solutions.”ACNB Corporation, headquartered in Gettysburg, PA, is the independent $2.7 billion financial holding company for the wholly-owned subsidiaries of ACNB Bank, Gettysburg, PA, and ACNB Insurance Services, Inc., Westminster, MD.

(NASDAQ: AMTB) (the “Company” or “Amerant”) today announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the “New Repurchase Program”), pursuant to which the Company may purchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of $25 million of its shares of Class A common stock. The New Repurchase Program will be effective from January 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023. The Company will not, however, repurchase shares prior to the release of 4Q 2022 earnings in January 2023.Jerry Plush, Chairman and CEO, stated, “We are pleased to announce that our Board has authorized this new buyback program, as this will provide us with the flexibility to make prudent capital management decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interests of our shareholders. We believe having an authorization in place is an essential component of a capital management program to return value to shareholders, and we intend to opportunistically repurchase shares from time to time while preserving sufficient capital to support our future growth.”Repurchases under the New Repurchase Program may be made in the open market, by block purchase, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Repurchases may also be made pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or other regulatory restrictions. The New Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of Class A common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.About Amerant Bancorp Inc.

       "  'Article': 'Byline Bancorp Announces Approval of New Stock Repurchase Program\\n\\nByline Bancorp, Inc. (“Byline” or the “Company”) (NYSE: BY), announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 1.25 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The shares authorized to be repurchased represent approximately 3.3% of the Company’s currently outstanding common stock. The new program will be effective January 1, 2023 and be in effect until December 31, 2023. Under its existing stock repurchase program expiring on December 31, 2022, Byline has purchased 2,139,262 shares of the 2.5 million total shares authorized for repurchase.\\n\\nRoberto R. Herencia, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Byline Bancorp, Inc., stated, “With the upcoming expiration of our current stock repurchase program, we determined it was prudent to authorize a new program that will continue to provide us with the flexibility to make capital allocation decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interests of stockholders. The program is an important part of our overall capital management strategy to return value to stockholders, which includes investments in the business, M&A opportunities, share repurchases, and our regular quarterly dividend. As market conditions change, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic stock repurchases on a regular basis as part of our balanced approach to capital deployment while we maintain sufficient capital to support the continued growth of Byline.”\\n\\nUnder the new program, shares may, at the discretion of management, be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases as market conditions warrant or in privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, all as effected to the extent permitted by applicable law, including pursuant to the safe harbor provided under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the program, and the program may be discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and share price of shares purchased under the repurchase program will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s stock, general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements.\\n\\nAbout Byline Bancorp, Inc.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Chicago, Byline Bancorp, Inc. is the parent company of Byline Bank, a full-service commercial bank serving small- and medium-sized businesses, financial sponsors, and consumers. Byline Bank has approximately $7.3 billion in assets and operates more than 30 full-service branch locations throughout the Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas.

       "  'Article': \"CNB Bank Introduces Women-Focused, Impressia Bank\\nCLEARFIELD, Pa., Dec.  12, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Together, Michael Peduzzi, President and CEO of CNB Bank, and Angela Wilcoxson, EVP/Chief Commercial Banking Officer, have announced plans to launch a new bank division, Impressia Bank. Designed for women by women, Impressia Bank will be a full-service banking division of CNB Bank dedicated to the professional and financial development and advancement of women business owners and women leaders.With plans to launch in early 2023, Impressia Bank will be the sixth bank division of CNB Bank. This women-focused commercial bank will begin within the existing geographic footprint of each of CNB Bank’s five other divisions, then strategically expand beyond those borders utilizing an online presence. Impressia Bank’s online approach will be complemented by regional relationship managers and support managers, as well as specialized services such as SBA and grant advisory services, treasury management, wealth management, and private banking.\\xa0\\xa0“This is a perfect opportunity to deepen relationships and support the already high, yet growing, number of women-owned businesses,” said Wilcoxson. “A prioritization of women-owned businesses would complement other divisional growth activities and allow the Bank to provide even better banking options for more businesses in our communities.”Extending beyond traditional business banking offerings, Impressia Bank clients will have access to resources related to accelerating their business, developing appropriate business strategies, and establishing a community of women who support one another. The Bank will connect financial and other identified resources to cultivate and support the business acumen of women business owners.“We’re looking to move beyond the scope of offering traditional banking services. Our goal is to provide an entire banking and financial support network for current and prospective women leaders,” said Mr. Peduzzi. “We recognize that access to capital remains the largest barrier to market entry and success for female founders and women-owned businesses. Impressia Bank will strive to propose solutions pertaining to credit access, financial literacy, and business development to promote and encourage the small business spirit and career development of women.”CNB Bank recently launched a search for the position of Division President for Impressia Bank.Based on strong, traditional values, CNB Bank is dedicated to being the premier financial services provider in the area, focused on the changing needs of people and business in our communities by providing the highest quality service.\\xa0About CNB Financial CorporationCNB Financial Corporation is a financial holding company with consolidated assets of approximately $5.3 billion.

In general, forward-looking statements usually use words such as “may,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “plan,” “estimate,” “predict,” “continue” and “potential” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, including statements related to the expected timing of the closing of the proposed transactions between the Company and Heritage (the “Merger”), the expected returns and other benefits of the Merger to shareholders, expected improvement in operating efficiency resulting from the Merger, estimated expense reductions resulting from the transactions and the timing of achievement of such reductions, the impact on and timing of the recovery of the impact on tangible book value, and the effect of the Merger on the Company’s capital ratios. Forward-looking statements represent management’s beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.\\n\\nForward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that change over time and could cause actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. With respect to the Merger, factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to (1) the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the Merger may not be realized or take longer than anticipated to be realized, (2) disruption from the Merger with customers, suppliers, employee or other business partners relationships, (3) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of one or both of the definitive agreement in respect of the Merger, (4) the risk of successful integration of Heritage into the Company, (5) the failure to obtain the necessary approval by the shareholders of Heritage, (6) the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger, (7) the ability by the Company to obtain required governmental approvals of the Merger, (8) reputational risk and the reaction of each of the companies’ customers, suppliers, employees or other business partners to the Merger, (9) the failure of the closing conditions in the definitive agreements in respect of the Merger to be satisfied, or any unexpected delay in closing of the Merger, (10) the risk that the integration of the operations of Heritage into the operations of the Company will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected, (11) the possibility that the Merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events, (12) the dilution caused by the Company’s issuance of additional shares of its common stock in the Merger, and (13) general competitive, economic, political and market conditions. Additional factors which could affect the forward looking statements can be found in the cautionary language included under the headings “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and other documents subsequently filed by the Company with the SEC. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.\\n\\nNeither the Company nor Heritage undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For any forward-looking statements made in this communication, any exhibits hereto or any related documents, the Company and Heritage claim protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221211005070/en/'},\n",

Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and estimates made by, management as of the date hereof. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “believes,” “continue” and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “would” and “could.”\\n\\nForward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the following risks and uncertainties and the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” of Exhibit 13 to U.S. Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Deterioration in general business and economic conditions or turbulence in domestic or global financial markets could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities, reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions, lead to a tightening of credit, and increase stock price volatility. In addition, changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or practices could affect U.S. Bancorp in substantial and unpredictable ways. U.S. Bancorp’s results could also be adversely affected by changes in interest rates; the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and prospects; increases in unemployment rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of its investment securities; legal and regulatory developments; litigation; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; civil unrest; the effects of climate change; changes in customer behavior and preferences; breaches in data security, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements; failures to safeguard personal information; the impacts of international hostilities or geopolitical events; impacts of supply chain disruptions and rising inflation; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management’s ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. In addition, U.S. Bancorp’s acquisition of MUFG Union Bank presents risks and uncertainties, including, among others: the risk that the cost savings, any revenue synergies and other anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized or may take longer than anticipated to be realized; the possibility that the combination of MUFG Union Bank with U.S. Bancorp, including the integration of MUFG Union Bank, may be more costly or difficult to complete than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results; and there can be no assurance that the community benefits plan will achieve the results or outcome expected or anticipated by U.S. Bancorp.\\n\\nFor discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from those described in forward-looking statements, refer to U.S. Bancorp’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled “Corporate Risk Profile” and “Risk Factors” contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, factors other than these risks also could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s results, and the reader should not consider these risks to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.\\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221201005646/en/'},\n",

As a result of those risks and uncertainties, our actual financial results in the future could differ, possibly materially, from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this news release and could cause us to make changes to our future plans. Those risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects; integration risks and projected cost savings in connection with acquisitions; the risk of geographic concentration in Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming, California, and Montana; the risk of changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity; the risk in our ability to continue to originate residential real estate loans and sell such loans; risks specific to commercial loans and borrowers; the risk of claims and litigation pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities; the risk of competition for investment managers and professionals; the risk of fluctuation in the value of our investment securities; the risk of changes in interest rates; and the risk of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and the risk in our ability to maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.

These statements relate to expectations concerning matters that are not historical facts. Accordingly, statements that are based on management’s projections, estimates, assumptions, and judgments constitute forward-looking statements. These forward looking statements, which are based on various assumptions (some of which are beyond the Bank’s control), may be identified by reference to a future period or periods, or by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “continue”, “plan”, “approximately”, “intend”, “objective”, “goal”, “project”, or other similar terms or variations on those terms, or the future or conditional verbs such as “will”, “may”, “should”, “could”, and “would”.Such forward-looking statements reflect the Bank’s current views and expectations based largely on information currently available to the Bank’s management, and on the Bank’s current expectations, assumptions, plans, estimates, judgments, and projections about the Bank’s business and industry, and they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Although the Bank believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, contingencies, and other factors. Accordingly, the Bank cannot give you any assurance that its expectations will in fact occur or that its estimates or assumptions will be correct. The Bank cautions you that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors: deterioration in employment levels, general business and economic conditions on a national basis and in the local markets in which the Bank operates; changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions, including concerns about inflation; the possibility that future credit losses will be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior or adverse economic developments; turbulence in the capital and debt markets; changes in interest rates and real estate values; competitive pressures from other financial institutions; changes in loan defaults and charge-off rates; changes in the value of securities and other assets, adequacy of loan loss reserves, or deposit levels necessitating increased borrowing to fund loans and investments; changing government regulation; changes in information technology, cybersecurity incidents, fraud, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and future pandemics; the risk that the Bank may not be successful in the implementation of its business strategy; and the other risks and uncertainties detailed in the Bank’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 as updated in the Bank’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings submitted to the FDIC.Jean-Pierre Lapointe, Chief Financial OfficerNortheast Bank, 27 Pearl Street, Portland, ME 04101 207.786.3245 ext. 3220www.northeastbank.com'},\n",

(NBT) (NASDAQ: NBTB) and Salisbury Bancorp, Inc. (Salisbury) (NASDAQ: SAL) announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Salisbury will merge with and into NBT. The merger consideration is 100% stock and is valued at approximately $204 million and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023 subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the shareholders of Salisbury and required regulatory approvals. The combination, approved unanimously by the boards of directors of both companies, will provide market extension for both institutions and join two high-quality franchises with long histories of service to their customers and communities.Salisbury is a premier community bank franchise headquartered in Lakeville, CT and had assets of $1.51 billion, deposits of $1.33 billion, and net loans of $1.18 billion as of September 30, 2022. Its primary subsidiary, Salisbury Bank and Trust Company, is a Connecticut-chartered commercial bank with 14 banking offices in northwestern Connecticut, the Hudson Valley region of New York and southwestern Massachusetts.Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of Salisbury common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.7450 shares of NBT common stock upon completion of the merger, which equates to a value of $35.00 per Salisbury share and based on NBT’s volume-weighted average closing stock price of $46.98 for the 10-day trading period ending on November 29, 2022.\\xa0The transaction is intended to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes, and as a result, the receipt of NBT common stock by shareholders of Salisbury is expected to be tax-free.NBT expects the transaction to be approximately 9.8% accretive to first full-year proforma GAAP earnings per share after close and 4.9% per share accretive to cash earnings excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, including fair value marks to securities and loans and the establishment of a core deposit intangible asset.\\xa0“We are very excited to partner with Salisbury and to extend our footprint into their attractive and complementary markets,” said NBT President and CEO John H. Watt, Jr. “Importantly, the organizational values upheld by the Salisbury team align very well with those of NBT.\\xa0We look forward to welcoming these dedicated financial professionals to NBT and growing our combined company together. We are also pleased that Rick Cantele, Salisbury’s President and CEO, will become a member of NBT’s Executive Management Team. Salisbury has an impressive history of service to their customers, communities and shareholders, and we are honored to have the opportunity to build on these relationships.”“We are proud to become part of a long-standing, high-performing franchise like NBT Bank,” said Salisbury President and CEO Richard J. Cantele, Jr. “We believe this combination will create significant value for Salisbury shareholders, both immediately and longer term. Furthermore, we are confident the operating philosophies shared by NBT and Salisbury will ensure that our customers continue to receive high-quality service from people they know and trust. NBT has been consistently recognized for superior customer satisfaction and offers comprehensive omni-channel solutions. Through the partnership between Salisbury and NBT, our customers will gain access to an expanded set of products, services and capabilities.”In recognition of both organizations' strong community focus, NBT has committed to maintaining charitable support in the markets served by Salisbury at consistent levels following the merger. NBT has also pledged to contribute an additional $500,000 in incremental support to demonstrate the company's ongoing commitment to these markets.Following the completion of the merger, Salisbury Bank and Trust offices will become NBT Bank, N.A. locations. NBT intends to establish a regional operations center in Lakeville, CT. The merger agreement also provides for one director from Salisbury to be added to the Board of Directors of NBT at closing.Piper Sandler & Co. served as financial advisor to NBT, and Janney Montgomery Scott LLC served as the financial advisor to Salisbury.

       "  'Article': 'Plato Gold Reports on Preliminary Prospecting and Sampling Program for the Pic River PGE-Cu Project\\nToronto, Nov.  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plato Gold Corp. (TSX-V: PGC) (OTCQB: NIOVF) (Frankfurt: 4Y7 or WKN: A0M2QX) is pleased to announce results from its recently completed preliminary prospecting and sampling program over select areas of the Pic River PGE-Cu Project, located 30 km northwest of Marathon, Ontario. The property is contiguous to the western boundary of Generation Mining Limited’s Marathon Palladium Copper Project and is located on strike with Generation Mining’s Sally Deposit. The work was conducted during a five-week period from July 1 to August 7, 2022. Due to the rugged nature of the topography in this area and limited ground access, only a select number of sites were visited across the property. Additional numerous coincident magnetic-electromagnetic (EM) anomalies determined from Plato’s October 2021 Prospectair Geosurveys airborne geophysical survey will be targeted and sampled during the company’s upcoming phase 2 program.A total of 50 closely spaced soil samples were collected for Soil Gas Hydrocarbon (SGH) analysis from an area of heavy overburden in the south-central portion of the Pic River claim group. In addition to the lack of exposed bedrock, a series of high priority EM and coincident magnetic anomalies, were outlined by Plato’s airborne survey in this particular area. Results from the SGH analysis indicate a significant copper-gold anomaly which will be tested by future diamond drilling.A total of 53 rock sample grabs were also collected for standard geochemical analysis from locations across the property. Results ranged from 5 ppm to 411 ppm Cu and 3 ppb to 331 ppb Au. Both ground-based prospecting and limited helicopter support were used to access sites.To address the access issue, during this initial groundwork, considerable time was spent clearing a 10 km trail along a historic logging road to provide access to the central portion of the property. This will assist in future planned exploration work, including prospecting and mapping, access for mechanized equipment (trenching and sampling) and diamond drilling.The technical and scientific disclosures in this news release were reviewed and approved by Gerald D.

Sanofi will also have the option to add up to two additional ANKETTM targets. Upon candidate selection, Sanofi will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization.\\n\\nInnate and Sanofi signed a first NK cell engagers collaboration in 2016 for the generation and evaluation of up to two bispecific NK cell engagers, which are currently being evaluated by Sanofi’s R&D team, with one of these molecules already in clinical studies.\\n\\nValeria Fantin, Ph.D., Global Head of Oncology Research at Sanofi\\n\\n“At Sanofi, we are exploring the potential of NK cells for cancer immunotherapy, a key pillar for our oncology strategy. Our relationship with Innate aligns with our commitment to work with promising French companies and supports our ambition to develop a diverse portfolio of next-generation NK cell engagers, highly synergistic with Sanofi’s allogeneic NK cell platform, engineered lymphokines that stimulate NK cells, and growing Immuno-oncology pipeline. As a leading global company with roots in France, we are proud to collaborate to support the French healthcare ecosystem.”\\n\\nYannis Morel, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Product portfolio strategy & Business development at Innate Pharma\\n\\n“Building on the success of our existing collaboration on hematologic targets, we are pleased to expand and strengthen our partnership with Sanofi on NK Cell Engagers with the addition of up to three new programs, including in solid tumors. Sanofi’s investment in Innate further validates the value of our ANKETTM platform and its potential to address multiple tumor types. By incorporating various tumor antigen binders, NK Cell Engagers are a versatile technology that may provide new options for patients and offer clinical benefit across multiple cancers, whilst also maintaining a good safety profile. This agreement also highlights Innate’s strategy to build a broad portfolio of ANKET programs addressing different types of cancer.”\\n\\nUnder the terms of the new license agreement, Innate will receive €25m upfront payment and up to €1.35bn total in preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones plus royalties on potential net sales. Closing of the transaction is subject to HSR approval.\\n\\n\\nAbout ANKETTM\\n\\nANKETTM (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate\\'s proprietary platform for developing next-generation, multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer.\\n\\nThis versatile, fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer. It leverages the advantages of harnessing NK cell effector functions against cancer cells and also provides proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells.\\n\\nOur latest innovation, the tetra-specific ANKET molecule, is the first NK cell engager technology to engage activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16), a tumor antigen and an interleukin-2 receptor (via an IL-2 variant, IL-2v) via a single molecule.\\n\\nAbout 2016 Sanofi/Innate research collaboration and licensing agreement\\n\\nIn 2016, Sanofi and Innate entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement for the generation and evaluation of up to two bispecific NK cell engagers, using technology from Innate Pharma and Sanofi’s proprietary bispecific antibody format as well as tumor targets.\\n\\nA Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is ongoing, evaluating IPH6101/SAR’579 (SAR443579), the first NKp46/CD16-based CD123-targeted ANKETTM NK cell engager, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).\\n\\nIn the summer 2022, Sanofi had made the decision to progress IPH6401/SAR’514 (SAR445514) into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. IPH6401/SAR’514 is a BCMA-targeting NK cell engager using Sanofi’s proprietary CROSSODILE® multi-functional platform, which comprises the Cross-Over-Dual-Variable-Domain (CODV) format. It induces a dual targeting of the NK activating receptors, NKp46 and CD16, for an optimized NK cell activation, based on Innate’s ANKETTM proprietary platform.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the original license agreement, Sanofi is responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of products resulting from the research collaboration. Innate Pharma will be eligible to up to €400m in development and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on net sales. To date, €13m milestone payments to Innate have been announced.\\n\\nAbout Sanofi’s approach to NK therapies in oncology\\n\\nAt Sanofi, we are exploring the intrinsic abilities of Natural Killer cells to create new immunotherapies for patients with cancer. Natural Killer cell-based therapies are a key pillar within Sanofi’s Oncology strategy. By activating the innate power of NK cells, Sanofi is advancing a diverse and complementary range of NK-based therapeutics to transform immune biology. The breadth of our modalities and unique strength to innovate end-to-end maximizes the therapeutic possibilities for more people with cancer.\\n\\n\\nAbout Sanofi\\n\\nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

You should not place undue reliance on those statements because they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our expectations regarding future results, interest rates and the interest rate environment, loan and deposit growth, loan performance, operations, new private client teams\\' hires, new office openings, business strategy and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each of the foregoing and on our business overall. Forward - looking statements often include words such as \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" “potential,” “opportunity,” “could,” “project,” “seek,” “target,” “goal,” “should,” “will,” “would,” \"plan,\" \"estimate\" or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements may also address our sustainability progress, plans, and goals (including climate change and environmental-related matters and disclosures), which may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. As you consider forward-looking statements, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us or in our control. These factors include but are not limited to: (i) prevailing economic conditions; (ii) changes in interest rates, loan demand, real estate values and competition, any of which can materially affect origination levels and gain on sale results in our business, as well as other aspects of our financial performance, including earnings on interest-bearing assets; (iii) the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans made by us, whether held in portfolio or sold in the whole loan secondary markets, which can materially affect charge-off levels and required credit loss reserve levels; (iv) changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; (v) changes in the banking and other financial services regulatory environment; (vi) our ability to maintain the continuity, integrity, security and safety of our operations and (vii) competition for qualified personnel and desirable office locations. All of these factors are subject to additional uncertainty in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, which are having impacts on all aspects of our operations, the financial services industry and the economy as a whole. Additional risks are described in our quarterly and annual reports filed with the FDIC. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, beliefs and expectations, if a change occurs or our beliefs, assumptions and expectations were incorrect, our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statements made by Signature Bank speak only as of the date on which they were made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and we cannot predict these events or how they may affect the Bank.

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, nor should they be relied upon as representing management’s views as of any subsequent date. These statements may include words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “appear,” “believe,” “could,” “should,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “would,” “seek,” “intend,” “probability,” “risk,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” “plans,” “potential,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are statements with respect to the Company’s beliefs, plans, expectations, objectives, goals, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For example, discussions of the effect of our expansion, benefits of the Share Repurchase Plan, trends in asset quality, capital, liquidity, the Company's ability to sell nonperforming assets, expense reductions, planned operational efficiencies and earnings from growth and certain market risk disclosures, including the impact of interest rates, tax reform, inflation, the impacts related to or resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other economic factors are based upon information presently available to management and are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations. By their nature, certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. Accordingly, our results could materially differ from those that have been estimated. The most significant factor that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include the ongoing impact of higher inflation levels, higher interest rates and general economic and recessionary concerns, all of which could impact economic growth and could cause a reduction in financial transactions and business activities, including decreased deposits and reduced loan originations, our ability to manage liquidity in a rapidly changing and unpredictable market, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and additional interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.Additional information concerning the Company and its business, including additional factors that could materially affect the Company’s financial results, is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2021, under “Part I - Item 1. Forward Looking Information” and in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any factors or to announce publicly the result of revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments.For further information:Julie Shamburger(903) 531-7134\"},\n",

       "  'Article': \"Unity Bank Opens Lakewood Branch, Plans New Fort Lee Branch\\nLAKEWOOD, N.J., Dec.  05, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unity Bank has opened a new full service branch in Lakewood at 1255 Route 70, expanding its branch network to Ocean County and the state’s fastest growing municipality. Unity also plans to open a Fort Lee branch in January, expanding the bank’s footprint in Bergen County.“Ocean County has lost almost 25% of its bank branches in the past decade and county officials are concerned that senior citizens in the county are underserved by the current population of banks,” said Unity Bank President & CEO James A. Hughes. “Our commercial and residential lending team has made significant inroads serving the unmet needs of the local community so the new branch is a logical extension of these efforts. Lakewood has been the fastest growing municipality in the state so this new branch makes good sense for the community and Unity.”Earlier this year, Unity established a commercial and residential lending office at the Route 70 facility, which is located at the intersection with Airport Road. The approximate 1,800-square-foot space, previously operated as a bank branch by another financial institution, now provides the full scope of local banking services.“Community banks are an engine for economic growth in the areas where they operate,” said Hughes. “During a time when large banks are closing branches, and other community banks are consolidating, we are expanding our commitment to the local marketplace to bring our full suite of products and services to small businesses and consumers in Ocean and Bergen Counties. We are providing capital for small businesses looking to open their first store, grow their business and hire more employees as well as families looking to purchase a house, or put an addition on their existing home. The heart of our business is seamless, easy to use deposit accounts with simple payment platforms and a commitment to excellent customer service.”According to the 2020 U.S. Census, Lakewood was New Jersey's fastest-growing municipality in the past decade and is now the state's fifth-largest city. Lakewood’s population soared 46% over the past decade, increasing from 92,843 residents to 135,158. Much of the dramatic growth has been attributed to an exodus of people from New York City to Ocean County.Details of a grand opening event for the Lakewood branch will be announced in January. The Fort Lee branch will be located at 899 Palisades Avenue and is expected to be open by late January. Once the Fort Lee facility is opened, Unity Bank will provide financial services to retail, corporate and small business customers through 20 branches in Bergen, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Ocean, Somerset, Union and Warren Counties in New Jersey and Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The bank holds about $2.3 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in deposits.About Unity Bancorp, Inc.Unity Bancorp, Inc.

       "  'Article': 'Missouri Employees Light Up St. Louis Community for a Good Cause\\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 19, 2022 / U.S. Bank:For U.S. Bank employee Amanda Trevisano Smith, giving back to others during the holiday season was instilled in her at a young age. And it all started with her grandmother.\"My grandmother had seven kids and was left to raise them on her own after my grandfather passed away serving in the U.S. military,\" explained Trevisano Smith, who is a hub manager and works out of the U.S. Bank Fenton, Missouri, branch, in St. Louis County. \"My grandmother used to take my Dad and his siblings to downtown St. Louis and gaze at the Christmas lights in window displays. It was something that everyone looked forward to that didn\\'t cost any money.\"So, 30 years ago when Trevisano Smith was a child, her dad felt inspired to create something similar at his house for people to enjoy. \"I remember Santa Night, when my dad would dress up and my siblings and I would be elves. Eventually, a lot of people started coming out to see the lights and they wanted to give my dad something for helping create special holiday memories, so our family started accepting donations and giving the proceeds to charity.\"Since 2004, the Trevisano family has donated more than $125,000 to St. Patrick Center to help thousands of people experiencing homelessness. U.S. Bank employees have joined in the spirit of volunteerism by helping Trevisano Smith\\'s family with the Christmas lights display, which sits within a neighborhood in the Crestwood community.\"Over the years, several U.S. Bank employees have reached out and signed up as a team to volunteer at Trevisano Teddy Bear Land - sometimes braving the cold, rain, and snow,\" said Katie Joseph, St. Patrick Center\\'s director of philanthropy operations. \"The community has the opportunity to view an amazing display and offer donations to help their neighbors in need. It is also unique because the family has taken pride in this for many years, and really believe in our mission. It is not about them; it\\'s how many people they can help. I hope when people drive by the display they are filled with the joy of the season and inspired to help their community.\"Branch Manager Jason Craft, who works at the nearby Sunset Hills branch, said it\\'s a heart-warming experience to volunteer at the event and see the smiles and cheer of the visitors.\"The whole purpose is to remember those less fortunate during the holiday season and to live out the mantra of giving versus receiving,\" he said. \"The spectacular decorative display attracts onlookers to help bring the holidays to life - even with their own radio station for onlookers to tune into during their visit! I am so inspired by the family\\'s ongoing commitment, effort and sacrifice each and every year to put on such a wonderful charitable event.\"Annually, U.S. Bank gives 16 hours of paid time off for eligible employees to volunteer in their communities. Last year, employees volunteered 731 hours per day with nonprofit organizations.\"It\\'s exciting to see the company encourage our employees to get out in the community and do good for others who may not be as fortunate,\" Trevisano Smith said. \"It means a lot to me that some of my colleagues have gotten involved to help our community in this way. I\\'ve worked for U.S. Bank for 13 years and I feel like it goes back to our core values - and living out what U.S. Bank wants to represent and what I\\'m passionate about within my family.\"Trevisano Smith said her dad spends up to 400 hours putting up the lights and starts in August so he can make everything just right. Today, her own children are involved and dress up as elves.\"This is what I am trying to instill in my children - that they are blessed and Christmas isn\\'t about getting, it\\'s about giving. It\\'s about seeing others happy.\"Learn more about U.S. Bank here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.html\\\\Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732343/Missouri-Employees-Light-Up-St-Louis-Community-for-a-Good-Cause\\n]]>'},\n",
